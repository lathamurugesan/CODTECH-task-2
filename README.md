TITLE:PREDICTIVE MODELING USING LINEAR REGRESSION

OBJECTIVE
The objective of my house price prediction project using linear regression is to accurately estimate house prices based on key features like location, size, and number of bedrooms. This model aims to help buyers, sellers, and real estate investors make informed decisions by providing reliable price predictions. Additionally, it seeks to identify the main factors influencing house prices, offering valuable market insights. The project also supports real estate agents in performing detailed market analysis and trend forecasting. Overall, it aims to enhance decision-making and investment strategies in the real estate market.

steps involved in house price prediction:
Data Collection: Gather data on house prices and related features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, age of the property, etc.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing/standardizing numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the distributions, correlations, and relationships between features and the target variable (house price).

Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features that significantly impact house prices.

Model Training: Use the training dataset to build the linear regression model, fitting it to the data to find the best-fit line that predicts house prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset and metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess accuracy.

Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model by adjusting parameters, removing outliers, or transforming features to improve its predictive accuracy.

Interpret and Validate: Interpret the model coefficients to understand the influence of each feature on house prices and validate the model using cross-validation techniques.

Deployment: Deploy the model for practical use, enabling stakeholders to input house features and receive price predictions.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.
